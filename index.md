# Book-making with super&shy;powers
{:.no_toc}

The Electric Book template produces **website, ebook, app and print books from a single content source.** It is [packed with features for professional book production](#basic-features), and lets team members collaborate on projects remotely. You're looking at the default website it generates. The template includes:

- [a blank book](book/0-3-contents.html) to start working into,
- [a book of sample features](samples/index.html) to learn from,
- [a demo translation](samples/fr/), and
- {% if site.output == "web" %}[how-to documentation](docs/){% else %}[online how-to documentation](https://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book/docs/index.html){% endif %}. {% if output-docs == true %}[Read the docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/){:.button}{% endif %}

You'll find [the open-source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book).

## Skill level

To make books this way, you need some web-development know-how. You'll edit content in markdown with Liquid template tags; edit data in YAML files; commit your changes with Git; enter commands at the command line; and build and serve a static website. Book content is in kramdown markdown, with Liquid tags, and in YAML. Design is done in Sass. Many features are written in Javascript.

If those concepts are not familiar to you, you'll need a web developer on your team to get you going, and to provide you with technical support when you get stuck.

You can also hire [Electric Book Works](https://electricbookworks.com) to provide support or to handle book production for you.

## Extending and integrating

### WordPress compatible

Do you already have a WordPress website? No problem. Electric Book websites are fully compatible with WordPress-driven servers. Just place our generated files in a subfolder on your WordPress server.

### Members-only option

Do you need to restrict book access to certain users on your WordPress site – like paying customers or authorised members? Use the [Electric Book WP plugin](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-wp/).

### Annotation

[Turn on open annotation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/setup/settings.html#annotation) on website editions with [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is). Useful for both public comment and private team discussions. [See annotation in action on this demo](https://deploy-preview-471--electric-book.netlify.app/).

### Open-source software

The template is [open-source software](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book), so you never have to worry about being locked out of your own books, or finding yourself at the mercy of one vendor's pricing. You can change anything about the Electric Book software yourself, as needed.

Note that the template does use the excellent [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/) for PDF output. Prince is not open-source, and is available as a free trial. We are [working on providing open-source alternatives](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book/issues/382).


## Technical advantages

### Free hosting

You can host an Electric Book site for free with services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The template works out of the box with both.

### Best-practice version control

The template is designed to work with [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git) version control software. We recommend storing and collaborating on your project on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.

### Separate image storage

For books with many large images, link to [remote media]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/images/external-media.html) and build Google Play apps with [expansion files]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/output/app-output.html#android).

### Continuous deployment

Wee provide setup guidance for setting up [free continuous deployment with CodeShip Basic](https://gist.github.com/arthurattwell/75cf124f22b9b4dbc6d8504d952f9406).
